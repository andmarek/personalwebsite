        <h3> History </h3>
        <br>
        <p> I am originally from Berwyn, Illinois.  I moved to Arizona when I was 6 years old and eventually
        moved back to Illinois to Downers Grove.  I went to high school at Downers Grove North, where I met my
        current long distance girlfriend, Natalie.
